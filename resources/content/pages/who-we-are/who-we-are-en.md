    ### The Haskell Foundation Interim Board of Directors

    The Haskell Foundation [board of directors](/board-of-directors) are
    responsible for managing and setting the direction of the Haskell
    Foundation. HF's current board will serve on an interim basis during the launch phase and will manage the establishment of the
    first full board in early 2021.
  team:
  - name: Simon Peyton Jones
    location: Chair

      Simon is a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.
      He started there in Sept 1998. He’s also an Honorary Professor of
      the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where he
      was a professor during 1990-1998.

      Simon is married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England.
      They have six children.

      Simon is interested in the design, implementation, and application
      of lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means he
      spends a most of my time on the design and implementation of the
      language Haskell. In particular, much of his work is focused
      around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.

      Simon is also chair of Computing at School, the group at the
      epicentre of the reform of the national curriculum for Computing
      in England. Computer science is now a foundational subject,
      alongside maths and natural science, that every child learns from
      primary school onwards.

      Chris has been interested in Haskell since the early reports and
      wrote the original Alex package in the 1990s. In the late
      nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and
      in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the
      ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for
      IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new
      IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell
      in the back end.

      Gabriele is Professor of Software Technology in the Department of
      Information and Computing Sciences. Her research focuses on how
      programming languages can be used to improve the quality of
      software. Conventional software testing is very important, but
      can’t guarantee the absence of errors. She is addressing this
      problem in her research on developing and using programming
      languages that are based on mathematical theory, so we can prove
      that a program will work in all scenarios. Call it
      ‘correctness by construction’. The real world significance is
      obvious: it saves a lot of time and it eliminates errors, so which
      company wouldn’t want it?

  - name: Jasper Van der Jeugt

      Jasper is a Principal Engineer at Fugue, a cloud security startup.
      He has been deeply involved in the Haskell community for over ten
      years, contributing as open source maintainer as well as community
      organizer, with efforts like ZuriHac and Summer of Haskell. He
      currently chairs the Haskell.org committee.

  - name: Edward Kmett
    location:  Interim Board Member

    description: |
      Edward spent most of his adult life trying to build reusable code
      in imperative languages before realizing he was building castles
      in sand. He converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for
      better building materials. He has sinced chaired the Haskell core
      libraries committee, collaborated with hundreds of other
      developers on over 200 projects on github, and is obsessed with
      finding better tools so that seven years from now we won’t be
      stuck solving the same problems with small variations on the same
      tools we were stuck using seven years ago.
    role:
  - name: Stephanie Weirich
    location:  Interim Board Member

    description: |
      Stephanie Weirich is an American computer scientist specializing
      in type theory, type inference, dependent types, and functional
      programming. She is a professor of computer science at the
      University of Pennsylvania.
      Weirich graduated magna cum laude in 1996 from Rice University,
      with a bachelor's degree in computer science. At Rice, she
      became interested in programming languages through an
      undergraduate research project with Matthias Felleisen. She
      moved to Cornell University for her graduate studies, completing
      her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation, Programming with Types,
      was supervised by Greg Morrisett. She joined the University of
      Pennsylvania faculty in 2002.
    role:
  - name: Simon Marlow
    location:  Interim Board Member

    description: |
      Simon Marlow is a British computer programmer, author, and
      co-developer of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He and Simon
      Peyton Jones won the SIGPLAN Programming Languages Software Award
      in 2011 for their work on GHC. Marlow's book Parallel and
      Concurrent Programming in Haskell was published in August 2013.
      Formerly of Microsoft Research, Marlow has worked at Facebook
      since March 2013. The "noted Haskell guru" is part of the team
      behind Facebook's open source Haxl project, a Haskell library
      that simplifies access to remote data.
